  Demonstration of creating a new Multi-site Analysis
</p>

A Multi-site Analysis is a collection of Sites.  Although it is possible to create a Multi-site Analysis with no Sites or just one Site, it won't be all that useful.  So far in this demo we have created just one site, but for this demo another site has been added to our account as can be seen in the above animation.

A Multi-site Analysis must have a name.  Below the input box for a name are two widgets that show which Sites are selected to be a part of the Multi-site Analysis and which Site have not yet been added.  To add Sites to the Multi-site Analysis, find the desired Site and click the `Add` button.  Once you click the `Add` button you will notice that the Site will now have moved to the list of Sites in the Multi-site Analysis.  If you wish to remove a Site from the Multi-site Analysis, you can click on the `Remove` button.  This will remove the site from the Multi-site Analysis, but will not delete the Site from your account.

Once you are satisfied with the Sites you have selected to be a part of the Multi-site Analysis, you can click the `Create` button.  This page is also used for editing existing Multi-site Analyses.  In those cases, you will see an `Update` button instead of the `Create` button.  Upon clicking either the `Update` or `Create` button, the webapp will take you to the Multi-site Analysis page of the Multi-site Analysis you just created or edited.
