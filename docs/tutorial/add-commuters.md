Adding commuters in bulk is a great way to expedite the process of adding commuters.  

## Preparing a CSV file

You will need to prepare a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file on your computer that has a list of the commuters you want to upload.  The csv file must have a header row with the columns `name` and `address` (case-sensitive).  Each row must then have the name of the commuter and the address of the commuter.  It is best to have the most precise address of a commuter possible, but the process will still work with zip codes or the city and state together for the address.

## Uploading to the website

Once you have a CSV file ready, you can either drag and drop the CSV to the dashed box or click on the dashed box to search your computer for the file.  Upon uploading the file, a new box will appear that can be expanded to preview the list of commuters about to be added.  To complete the process, click on the `Add Commuters` button.

Once you've clicked the `Add Commuters` button, the webapp will take you back to the [Site Page](site.md) and will begin geocoding commuters and calculating commuting statistics.
